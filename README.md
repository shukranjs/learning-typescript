# TypeScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my **TypeScript Learning Repository**! This repository is a collection of my TypeScript learning journey, organized by topics and projects. It contains code examples, explanations, and mini-projects to demonstrate what I have learned.

Through this repository, I aim to learn TypeScript by practicing fundamental concepts, building intermediate and advanced skills, and showcasing my progress through meaningful projects. Each section is carefully designed to provide a structured and practical approach to mastering TypeScript.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Basics
The `basics/` folder contains fundamental TypeScript concepts, such as:
- **Hello World**: Setting up TypeScript and running the first program.
- **Types and Interfaces**: Exploring basic types, interfaces, and type aliases.
- **Enums**: Understanding enumerations and their practical uses.

[Go to Basics](./basics/README.md)

### 2. Intermediate
The `intermediate/` folder includes more advanced concepts like:
- **Generics**: Reusable and type-safe components.
- **Utility Types**: Practical examples using `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.
- **Type Guards**: Techniques for narrowing types.

### 3. Advanced
The `advanced/` folder covers the most complex TypeScript features:
- **Decorators**: Exploring class and method decorators.
- **Type Inference**: Advanced type manipulation and inference examples.
- **Conditional Types**: Using `extends`, `infer`, and conditional logic in types.

### 4. Projects
The `projects/` folder includes practical implementations and mini-projects:
- **Calculator**: A simple calculator app showcasing basic TypeScript concepts.
- **To-Do List**: A type-safe to-do application.
- **API Client**: Building and using a type-safe client to interact with APIs.
